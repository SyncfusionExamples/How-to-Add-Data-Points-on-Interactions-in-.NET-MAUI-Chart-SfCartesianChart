This article in the Syncfusion Knowledge Base explains  how to add data points on interactions in the .NET MAUI Chart platform.
This article explains how to add data points on interactions in the [.NET MAUI Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts).
In .NET MAUI Chart, you can add data points to the chart using touch interactions.
The approach involves customizing the touch behavior by overriding the [OnTouchUp]() method of the [ChartInteractiveBehavior ]() class.
**Step 1:** Create the ChartInteractionExt class with inherited from the [ChartInteractiveBehavior]() class. Assign the ChartInteractionExt class to the ChartInteractiveBehavior property of the [SfCartesianChart]((https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts)).   
**[XAML]**
```
</chart:SfCartesianChart>
    . . .
    <chart:SfCartesianChart.InteractiveBehavior>
        <local:ChartInteractionExt/>
    </chart:SfCartesianChart.InteractiveBehavior>
</chart:SfCartesianChart>
```
**[C#]**
```
SfCartesianChart chart = new SfCartesianChart();
    . . .
ChartInteractionExt interaction = new ChartInteractionExt();
chart.ChartInteractiveBehavior = interaction;
    . . .
```    
**Step 2:**  Customize the touch behavior by overriding the  [OnTouchUp]() method within the ChartInteractionExt class to handle the touch-up events on a chart.
Use the [PointToValue]() method to convert the touch coordinates (pointX and pointY) into corresponding data values on the X and Y axes of the [SfCartesianChart]((https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts)).   
**[C#]**
```
public class ChartInteractionExt : ChartInteractiveBehavior
{
    protected override void OnTouchUp(ChartBase chart, float pointX, float pointY)
    {
        base.OnTouchUp(chart, pointX, pointY);

        if (chart is SfCartesianChart cartesianChart)
        {
            var x = cartesianChart.PointToValue(cartesianChart.XAxes[0], pointX, pointY);
            var y = cartesianChart.PointToValue(cartesianChart.YAxes[0], pointX, pointY);

            if (cartesianChart.BindingContext is ViewModel viewModel)
            {
                viewModel.Data.Add(new Model(x, y));
            }
        }
    }
}
```
